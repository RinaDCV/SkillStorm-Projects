                  </div>
                  <p>In the year 1989, in Ahuachapán, El Salvador, I was born and raised by my grandmother until the age of seven. I am the youngest of four children but the age gap between siblings was greater than 10 years old that growing up felt like being an only child. I attended a private Catholic School where I spoke, wrote, and understood Spanish, being the native language of El Salvador. My mother at the time had left to the United States to work and raise money to bring all four of her children to the United States. At the age of seven two of my siblings had already traveled to the States and I was next. I learned my first English words from watching Disney movies at an uncle’s house before I left on a plane to the States by myself.</p>

                  </div>
                  <p>In the 1996, I was dropped off at the airport and traveled to the United States. I arrived at Los Angeles Airport in California where my mother greeted me and took us to my uncle’s house in Downtown Los Angeles. From that moment on my whole life changed, it was a culture shock, and my mother made it clear that I was to learn English and learn everything I could aways. Of course, at seven, I did not do that immediately. </p>
                  <p>
                    Not long after arriving my mother moved us to Redondo Beach, California so that we could attend a school in a good school District. To make sure that I learned English well, my mother had me repeat the second grade so that I would not fall behind due to the language barrier. As the years passed, I graduated elementary, middle, and high school. Throughout the years of being raised in California I made friends, celebrated all American holidays, I played sports and was part of the JROCT all four years in high school. While my mother’s plan was for me to attend college and graduate, 2 years into college I changed my mind and decided to take a different route.

                  </div>
                  <p>In 2009, I decided to join the Marine Corps. It was something I thought about doing right after high school but since I wasn’t 18 at the time my mother would not sign, and so I went to college to study Psychology. One day, I was thinking about my life and what I could do to be more, that was when I circled back to the idea of joining the military. I probably should have done more research about joining but I was eager to join and leave, I did not hesitate. I signed up to join and in two weeks I was stepping on the yellow footprints to begin bootcamp. While I did tell my family and friends no one wanted me to join, so I proceeded on this journey alone. Three months later I earned the title “United States Marines” and it felt so good.</p>

                  <p>While in the Marine Corp I continued my education. In 2010, I began taking classes again and changed my career plan and began studying business administration to align with my job occupation in the military as a logistic specialist. In 2014, I earned my Associates in Arts. From 2014 to 2020, I continued my education and completed my bachelor’s degree in Business Administration with a Minor in Psychology in February 2020.</p>

                  <p>In 2014, after my re-enlistment in the Marine Corp, I applied to become a United States Citizen. I took classes, a written test and a verbal test and was declared a United States Citizen after I passed. This is an important highlight in my life because I consider myself American and this added value to why I served in the military. Ever since I arrived in the United States, it has provided me the opportunity to grow in many ways that I might not have had the opportunity to in El Salvador. To me, it truly was and is the land of opportunity, you just have to find it and give it your all and you can succeed.</p>

                  <p>In 2017, my eight years in the military were coming to an end, and instead of re-enlisting I decided to conclude my time in the military so that I could be more present in raising my daughter, who was 5 years old at the time. On 17 May 2017, I was honorably discharged and left for Japan with my husband and daughter. For a Year we lived in Okinawa City, Japan with the locals. I left Japan with my daughter in 2018 after I was divorced and returned to San Diego California. While in California I finished my last classes for my degree and took care of my daughter.</p>

                  <p>In 2022, as we were getting ready to buy a home in California, my husband received notice of a position opening in Florida, and it was all his if he wanted it. The only catch was that we had to pack and move in 60 days. Always wanting to leave California we jumped on the opportunity and since we were already planning on moving it worked out in a sense. We went from moving a few miles away to moving cross country, not an experience I would repeat, but we are happy where we relocated to. We now have a home that we call our own and our daughter can enjoy her childhood without moving around so much.</p>
