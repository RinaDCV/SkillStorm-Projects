                <h2>Getting to know me</h2>
                <p>
                  I believe every life experience whether good or bad have mold me into the woman that I am today. I strive to learn from my mistakes, lisen and learn from those around me and create a better future for those that come after me. My childhood taught me to be independent, the military taught me to never give up, school continues to teach me that hardwork pays off , and motherhood teaches me patience. All of which I apply in everything that I engage in. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  I am most happy being surround by my loved ones, while I do not have the traditional large family, I enjoy all the prceless moments with my daughter, husband, and dogs. We can be out on vacation, on a hike, at the beach or just enjoying a movie on the couch, and they are all amazing because we are together.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Some things that I enjoy doing are: art, lisen to music, cooking, swimming. I could paint, sketch, and color all day. I tend to do art pieces for my friends and family and some I put around our house was wall art. I lisen to music every chance, its more for the beats than for the lyrics, its something I just enjoy. I love being able to cook new recepies to try new flavors.  Swimming is my favorite workout, its not onl a full body workout but it easy on the joints.
